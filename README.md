A Node.js implementation of cbNetwork
=====================================

Coding conventions
------------------
* No tabs; use 2 spaces instead.
* Variables and functions use camelCaps, so the first letter is lowercase and
  the following words have their first letter in uppercase.
* Classes names start with a capital letter and so follow CamelCaps rules.
* Constants are written in uppercase and words are delimited with underscores "_".
* Column limit is 100, but it is not enforced - so no stupid midstatement newlines!
* Document your functions, classes, methods and complex structures with jsdoc-toolkit
